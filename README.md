## This is a React-based skeleton for a map application
This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The project uses [Sass3 - .scss](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax) CSS pre-processor.

## Run the application
1. [Clone or download](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the source code of the application to your computer
2. Install Node.js if not installed [from Download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or [via package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
3. Go to the application directory
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `npm start`
6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will be reloaded automatically when you make changes to the project















## Build the application
Run `npm run build` from the application directory 
This builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
